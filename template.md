### Creating Charts

To create a chart:

   import { createChart } from 'chart-and-sheet';
   ```

2. Initialize a chart in your application:

   ```javascript
   const chart = createChart('chart-container', {
       type: 'bar',
       data: {
           labels: ['January', 'February', 'March'],
           datasets: [
               {
                   label: 'Sales',
                   data: [150, 200, 180],
                   backgroundColor: ['#ff6384', '#36a2eb', '#cc65fe'],
               },
           ],
       },
   });
   ```

3. Customize as needed with additional options.

### Working with Sheets

To manage spreadsheets:

1. Import the spreadsheet module:

   ```javascript
   import { createSheet } from 'chart-and-sheet';
   ```

2. Initialize a spreadsheet:

   ```javascript
   const sheet = createSheet('sheet-container', {
       columns: ['Name', 'Age', 'Salary'],
       data: [
           ['Alice', 30, '$50,000'],
           ['Bob', 25, '$45,000'],
       ],
   });
   ```

3. Enable features like formulas and conditional formatting:

   ```javascript
   sheet.addFormula('C3', '=B2 * 1.1');
   sheet.applyConditionalFormatting('C1:C10', 'greaterThan', 50000, { color: 'red' });
   ```

### Example Outputs
